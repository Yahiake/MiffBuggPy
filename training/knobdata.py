Read a render database produced by LiveSPICE's `render` command and pack it for training.

The database is a folder holding:
    manifest.jsonl          one JSON object per render (the source of truth)
    input/normalized.wav    the single normalized input recording, shared by every render
    renders/*.wav           one output per render, named by the manifest

Every render was produced by running one segment of the shared input through the circuit
at one knob setting. The renderer's gain is not baked into the files -- it is applied to the
input before the circuit sees it, and recorded per render -- so the input has to be rebuilt
here as `segment * input_gain`. That is the single place where a mistake would poison
training while still looking plausible, so it is asserted rather than assumed.

Packing exists only for speed: `prepare` writes one memmapped target array and an index, so
an epoch never touches 1600 individual files. It changes nothing about the data.

    Assign train / val / test by INPUT SEGMENT, not by row, and write the choice out.

    Why this replaces a row-wise split
    ---------------------------------
    Every render in this database is a different window onto the *same*
    input/normalized.wav. Shuffling rows therefore produces a validation set that
    contains unseen knob settings but audio the model has already been fitted to,
    often the identical waveform shifted by a fraction of a second. The reported ESR
    then measures how well the network interpolates over knob settings while quietly
    leaning on memorised audio, and it looks better than the model really is.

    So the split is made on the source timeline: each render's offset_s falls into one of
    a few contiguous time bands, and a whole band belongs to exactly one split.

    The bands are separated by a gap at least one render long. Without that the leak
    survives, because a render covers [offset, offset + duration] and consecutive bands
    are adjacent: with 5 s renders on a 0.25 s offset grid, a train render starting at
    120 s reaches 125 s, so a val render starting at 120.25 s shares 4.75 s of audio with
    it. Guarding costs some source audio and is worth it.

    Two secondary properties are preserved:

    * Each render stays a self-contained (input segment, knob setting, output) triple;
      audio is never carved out of the middle of one.
    * Every split spans the whole knob surface, because the stratified sampler
      distributes knob settings across all offsets rather than tying them to one.
