"""
Train the knob-conditioned model on a LiveSPICE render database.

    python train.py prepare   --db DATASET
    python train.py train     --db DATASET [options]
    python train.py eval      --db DATASET --ckpt CHECKPOINT
    python train.py export    --db DATASET --ckpt CHECKPOINT [--split test]

`prepare` packs the database for fast epochs and draws the train/val/test split. The
renderer deliberately does not assign one, so the split can be redrawn without re-rendering
anything; it is written to `split.json` and reused from then on.

`train` runs truncated BPTT. The state is carried across chunks and detached between them,
and validation runs the whole window free-running. That difference is not a detail: training
with TBPTT=1 is teacher forcing, and a model trained that way measures roughly 19% error
free-running against roughly 3.9% at TBPTT=64 on the same architecture.

The reported metric is ESR, averaged over clips, matching NAM and DAFx-19 so the number can
be compared with published results.

    One pass over a batch of windows, in TBPTT chunks. Returns the whole-batch loss.

    Each clip is scored by its own ESR -- sum of squared error over sum of squared target --
    even though the backward passes are per chunk. Summing a chunk's squared error against
    the *whole window's* target energy means the chunks sum to exactly the window's ratio
    while only one chunk of graph stays alive at a time.

    `mode` chooses how clips are weighted against each other; see `losses.clip_weights` for
    why that is a real decision and not a detail. All modes score silence at exactly 1.0, so
    there is no floor for the loss to slide down toward.

    `mrstft_weight` adds a multi-resolution spectral term on the same scored region, weighted
    by the same clip weights. It is computed per chunk for the same reason the ESR term is:
    the chunk is the longest run with a live graph attached. That constrains its FFT sizes to
    fit `tbptt` -- see `losses.mrstft_resolutions` for what that costs. Zero disables it.

    `burn` is the number of leading samples fed through the network purely to settle the
    recurrent state, with no loss attached. This matters more than it looks. Every window
    starts from a zero state, and a GRU coming from zero has to be walked to its operating
    point before its output means anything. Scoring that transient teaches the network to
    predict the approach from a state it will never be asked to reproduce at inference, and
    it inflates the loss with an error the plugin will never actually make. The fix is
    NAM's: burn in, then score only what follows. See NAM's nam_full_configs/models/lstm.json,
    train_burn_in 8192 / mask_first 8192, and the comment "use a long ny like 32768" -- their
    burn-in alone is longer than this trainer's entire window used to be.

    The burn-in chunks still detach like any other TBPTT chunk. NAM deliberately does *not*
    detach across the burn-in boundary so the state stays learnable, which is only possible
    without TBPTT; here the detached path is what keeps memory bounded, and the state is
    still trained on by every scored chunk.

    With `opt` given, gradients accumulate and the caller steps. Without, it evaluates.
