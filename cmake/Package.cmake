# Assembles a release folder from the built artefacts.
#
# Deliberately a copy of exactly three things:
#
#   <name>.vst3/        the VST3 bundle, as a bundle
#   <name>.exe          the standalone build
#   README.txt          what the files are and where they go
#
# Three details this exists to get right:
#
#   * The VST3 is copied as a directory, preserving Contents/. Copying the file out of
#     the bundle - or zipping the bundle's contents rather than the bundle - produces
#     something several hosts will not load, and they fail silently by not listing the
#     plugin rather than by reporting an error.
#
#   * <name>.exp and <name>.lib sit next to the bundle in the build tree. They
#     are link-time artefacts, they are 3 KB, and shipping them invites the question of
#     what they are. They are excluded by copying a named list rather than by copying the
#     directory and deleting afterwards.
#
#   * DEST is emptied first, and it is allowed to be inside the source tree. So the
#     README is read from READMESRC, not from DEST - a script that clears its own input
#     directory works exactly once and then silently ships with no README.
#
# Run with:
#   cmake -DSTAGE=<artefacts dir> -DDEST=<output dir> -DREADMESRC=<file> \
#         -DBUNDLE=<MiffBuggPy.vst3> -DEXE=<MiffBuggPy.exe> -P Package.cmake
#
# BUNDLE and EXE are passed in rather than hardcoded so the script keeps working
# when the product is renamed, and so a stale name fails loudly at configure time
# instead of at packaging time.
